# CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions, Docker, and Kubernetes

This project implements a complete CI/CD pipeline for a web application using open-source tools. It automates building, testing, containerization, and deployment to a Kubernetes cluster.

[How to Run](#how-to-run-steps)

## Features

- **CI with GitHub Actions**: Automates building and testing.
- **Containerization**: Uses Docker for builds and runs.
- **Artifact Storage**: Stores build artifacts in GitHub Packages.
- **Testing**: Unit tests, E2E tests with Cypress, and performance/security tests.
- **Deployment**: Deploys to a Kubernetes cluster on EC2 with blue/green deployments.
- **Secrets Management**: Uses GitHub Secrets for storing credentials.
- **Monitoring**: Implements performance and metrics monitoring.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Automates pipeline setup with Ansible/Puppet.

## Technologies Used

- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: EC2 (via SSH)
- **Testing**: ESLint, Karma, Jasmine, Cypress
- **Artifact Storage**: GitHub Packages
- **Secrets Management**: GitHub Secrets
- **Automation**: Ansible

## How to Run

For detailed instructions on how to set up and run the pipeline, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Click the 'Fork' button at the top of this page.
2. **Clone the Repo**: 
   ```bash
   git clone $repo_link
   cd repo-name
3. **Set Up GitHub Secrets**: 
   - Go to your GitHub repository's settings.
   - Under the "Secrets and variables" section, select "Actions".
   - Add the following secrets:
     - `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`: Your DockerHub username.
     - `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`: Your DockerHub password or personal access token.
     - `EC2_HOST`: The private key for EC2 access.
     - `EC2_USER`: The user to access the EC2 instance.
     - `KUBERNETES_KUBECONFIG`: Kubernetes config file or base64-encoded kubeconfig (depending on your setup).
     - `SSH_KEY`: The SSH key you set for your EC2 instance to run with.

   **Alternatively**, if you want to automate this process and insert the secrets into your GitHub repository immediately, you can use the provided Ansible script. Here's how:

   - Ensure you have the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) installed and authenticated with your GitHub account.
     ```bash
     gh auth login
     ```
   - Run the following Ansible playbook locally to insert the secrets into your GitHub repository automatically:
     ```bash
     ansible-playbook -i inventory git-repo-playbook.yaml 
     ```
   - You'll insert values for them in the playbook and it will automatically insert them into your repository as GitHub secrets.

4. **Set Up AWS EC2 Instance**:
   - Ensure your EC2 instance has access to Docker and Kubernetes.
   - Configure the instance with a public IP for SSH access and ensure proper security group settings. Allow inbound traffic for necessary ports.

   The Ansible script does the following:
   1. **Install Dependencies**: It updates the system package manager (`apt`) and installs `curl`.
   2. **Install K3s**: It fetches and installs K3s using the official installation script from Rancher, ensuring that itâ€™s set up with the appropriate configuration for your EC2 instance.
   3. **Start K3s**: The script enables and starts the K3s service.
   4. **Wait for Kubernetes to Be Ready**: It ensures that the K3s Kubernetes service is ready by checking the status of the nodes.
   5. **Configure Kubeconfig**: The script creates a symlink to the K3s configuration file, sets the appropriate ownership, and ensures that the kubeconfig file uses the EC2 instance's public IP for accessing the Kubernetes cluster.

   **To run the playbook**:
   1. Make sure you have Ansible installed on your local machine.
   2. Ensure you can SSH into the EC2 instance.
   3. Run the Ansible playbook:
      ```bash
      ansible-playbook -i inventory k3s-playbook.yaml
      ```

   This will automate the entire Kubernetes installation process on your EC2 instance, making it ready for use in your CI/CD pipeline.

5. **Run the CI Pipeline**:
   - **Once you push any changes to your repository, GitHub Actions will automatically trigger the CI pipeline**.
   - The pipeline will:
     - Run linting and unit tests.
     - Build the Docker image.
     - Push the Docker image to DockerHub.
     - Deploy the application to Kubernetes on Ubuntu EC2.
     - Run Cypress E2E tests.

6. **Access the Application**:
   - After the deployment, access your application using the EC2 Public IP and the NodePort from the deployment. Example: `http://13.60.99.107:32320/`

7. **Monitor and Debug**:
   - Check the GitHub Actions logs for each step of the CI/CD process.
   - For more details on performance and security testing, refer to the relevant reports generated in the pipeline.

8. **Enable Email Notifications for CI/CD Build Failure and Success**:
   - GitHub provides built-in email notifications for CI/CD build success or failure. To enable email notifications for your workflow status, follow these steps:
   
     1. **Navigate to Your GitHub Repository Settings**:
        - Go to the **Settings** tab of your repository.
   
     2. **Go to Notifications Settings**:
        - Under the **Notifications** section in the left sidebar, click on **Watching**.
   
     3. **Set Up Email Notifications**:
        - Make sure you are **Watching** the repository. This setting will ensure you get notifications for all activities, including workflow runs.
   
     4. **Configure Workflow Notifications**:
        - GitHub will automatically send email notifications for workflow status changes, such as when a build succeeds or fails. You can configure these notifications at a more granular level by adjusting the "Actions" notification settings:
          - Go to your profile settings by clicking your profile picture in the top-right corner of GitHub.
          - Click on **Settings** > **Notifications**.
          - Under **Actions**, select **Email** for notifications on workflow failures or successes.

   By enabling this feature, you will receive email alerts for both successful and failed CI/CD builds, keeping you informed of your workflow status directly in your inbox.
